# Signalbroker web client

This project contains two things

- Web frontend interface for [signalbroker](https://github.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-server) implemented using gRPC-Web
- Exposes websocket interface enabling simpler js applications. Sample is included.

# Prerequisites
## Signal Broker

Before starting, the [signalbroker](https://github.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-server) must be running.

- [Install elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).
- Clone this repository.
 of the box).
- Start the software by doing.

```
mix deps.get
iex -S mix
```
if your signalbroker server is running on another machine do:
```
mix deps.get
SIGNAL_SERVER_HOST_NAME=10.251.177.205 iex -S mix
```

## Envoy
Envoy must be running and should be connected to the Signal Broker Server.
Check [readme](configuration/grpc_web/README.md) on how to get started.

## Alternatively; start using docker

```bash
docker build -t signalbroker-web-client:v1 -f ./docker/Dockerfile .
```


just start it using the correct ip. Remember don't use 127.0.0.1, instead use the **real** signalbroker machine ip
```bash
docker run -e SIGNAL_SERVER_HOST_NAME='192.168.1.169' --rm -it -p 8080:8080 signalbroker-web-client:v1
```

note 1: you should be able to do above on intel or arm. However ARM is not testad at this point.

quick test, the mini web sample should now work if you follow the instructions *Websocket Web Client* found below

# Run the gRPC front-end web client
Point your browser to [http://you_envoy_machine_ip:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). You will be notified that the Signal Broker Envoy is offline. This is because you need to specify the correct IP according to your configurations. Click the red field in the status bar at the bottom which reads "Signal Broker Envoy". Configure it by setting your Envoy IP, http://[your_envoy_server]:8081


# gRPC front-end web client configuration

If you want to customize the gRPC web client, follow these instructions.

1. See [readme libraryCompiler](libraryCompiler/README.md) to take the GRPC generated files and bundle them into a javascript library. You will need to run this again anytime you make changes to the GRPC files. Changes in the front-end (clientSource) might be needed as well if functions are added, removed, or renamed. DO NOT modify the generated files or the `api.js` file generated by webpack.
2. Then see [readme clientSource](clientSource/README.md) to configure the front-end web client built with VueJS which is preconfigured to use the library from step 1. The resulting production build can be hosted on a web server of your choice or you may prefer to use the development server by running `yarn serve`. If you intend to host the production version on `Cowboy`, then copy the generated `/dist` folder to `signalbroker-web-client/priv/` after running `yarn build`. Remember to point the web client to the correct Envoy IP.
3. You should now be able to point your browser to the webserver, select some frames and/or signals and see some charted traffic!

# Help us improve!

The gRPC front-end web client for the Signal Broker is in active development and would appreciate your feature suggestions or bug reports. File them as issues in this repository :)


# Websocket Web Client
Easier to get started, but less capable option and predecesor to the gRPC client.

To access the *Websocket client* UI point your web browser to http://localhost:8080/websocket_demo/web_car.html


## Websocket API

The API is simply the same as the [telnet API](https://github.com/volvo-cars/signalbroker-server/blob/master/apps/app_telnet/README.md) but sent over websocket.


For a working sample of how to use the code go to `priv/websocket_demo/js/web_car.js`.

## TODO - help appreciated
- [ ] add envoy to the docker image, alternatively use docker compose.
